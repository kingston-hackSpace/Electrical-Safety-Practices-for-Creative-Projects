# Electrical Safety Practices for Creative Projects

A guide for creatives working with physical computing, electronics, and powered installations.

### Electrical basis

**Voltage** : Measured in **volts(V)**. It is the electrical pressure that pushes current through a circuit.

**Current** : Measured in **amperes(A) or milliamperes(mA)**. It is the flow of electrical charge. Higher current = more heat in wires and components.

**Power** : Measured in **watts(W)**. It is the rate at which electrical energy is used.


Formula: Power = Voltage × Current

**Why this matters**

Understanding these three values helps prevent overloads, component failure, and fire risk.
